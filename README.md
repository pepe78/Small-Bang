# Small-Bang
[Small bang](http://www.frisky.world/p/small-bang.html) is an email client, which clusters (groups) your emails so that you can see all your related emails together. It also sorts your clusters by your priorities, so you do not miss a thing. It enables you to mark whole cluster as read, in case you have too many new "spam" messages and you want to mark them all as read with one click. If you click on an email, it opens the message, so you can read it, reply to it, etc. All you need is Outlook.com account or Office365 account as the project was written using Microsoft's new Office Graph API.
